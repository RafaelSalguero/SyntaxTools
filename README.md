# SyntaxTools ‚ù§
A library for analysis of code, written to be a compiler framework in the not so distant future :)

Top namespaces:
 - `DataStructures` - Contains basic data structures used by almost all parts of the project
 - `Text` - Provides a powerful and extensible state machine based tokenizer and other string procesing mini tools
 - `Global` - The library uses guids for representing symbols, the class `GuidNames` contains friendly names for those
